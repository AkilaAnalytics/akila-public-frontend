Imagine a world where marketers have the power to unleash their creativity without constraints. A world where they can effortlessly deliver the right offer to the right person, at the right time, in a way that feels seamless and personalized. This utopia of hyperpersonalization at scale is now within reach, thanks to the transformative potential of Gen AI.

Gen AI is revolutionizing consumer marketing, enabling companies to roll out marketing campaigns with unprecedented speed and personalization. What once took months of content design, insight generation, and customer targeting can now be accomplished in a matter of weeks or even days. With Gen AI, marketers can analyze and interpret various types of data, including text, image, and video, to uncover new innovation opportunities and deliver value to customers like never before.

The global economic marketplace is already feeling the ripple effects of Gen AI. McKinsey estimates that Gen AI has the potential to contribute up to $4.4 trillion in annual global productivity, with marketing and sales being one of the primary beneficiaries. Companies that embrace this technology stand to gain a significant competitive advantage, while those that choose to sit on the sidelines risk being left behind in this new era of marketing.

In this article, we explore three ways consumer companies can unlock the power of Gen AI to create value. Firstly, companies can start by leveraging existing Gen AI models to personalize marketing campaigns, generate insights from unstructured customer data, and automate processes. These off-the-shelf solutions provide immediate value and help build the necessary capabilities to fully harness the potential of Gen AI.

However, companies that truly want to differentiate themselves must go beyond off-the-shelf solutions. They need to develop customized, bespoke Gen AI models trained on their own data sets. By reshaping existing models, companies can achieve exponential improvements in customization and drive growth across all aspects of their marketing efforts.

We are already seeing early adopters making strides with Gen AI. For example, Michaels Stores has achieved remarkable results by personalizing 95 percent of its email campaigns, resulting in a 41 percent increase in click-through rates for SMS campaigns and a 25 percent increase for email campaigns. Stitch Fix and Instacart are leveraging Gen AI to enhance their personalized customer experiences and drive higher engagement.

As companies embark on their Gen AI journey, it is crucial to establish clear goals and focus on a few key use cases that deliver immediate impact. Mitigating risks, such as biases, data privacy violations, and copyright infringement, should also be a top priority. Gen AI is not a one-size-fits-all solution and may not be suitable for high-stakes decision-making or heavily regulated environments.

Looking ahead, the future of marketing with Gen AI holds immense potential. Nearly all marketing tasks could be assisted by Gen AI, resulting in greater innovation and unique customer experiences that fuel growth. However, it is vital to maintain guardrails to protect sensitive information and ensure compliance with ethical and legal standards.

In conclusion, Gen AI is transforming the marketing landscape, enabling hyperpersonalization and efficiency gains at an unprecedented scale. Companies that seize this opportunity will be at the forefront of innovation and set themselves apart in the competitive market. The time to embrace Gen AI is now, as it has the power to revolutionize marketing and drive sustainable growth in the digital age. Unlocking the potential of gen AI in marketing requires a confident and proactive approach. Companies must strive to create a future where customer-facing use cases are effortlessly envisioned, built, and designed. Embracing a gen-AI-based transformation is a certainty in the coming years, and it's crucial for companies to take the necessary steps to stay ahead.

To begin the journey, marketers should establish a North Star vision and road map that align with the organization's unique context. This vision should leverage gen AI technology to address time, cost, and resource-intensive tasks while adhering to responsible AI principles. By carefully considering the company's capabilities, competitive landscape, and customer needs, marketers can determine where to invest and what to prioritize. It is essential to ensure alignment and coordination from top-level leadership regarding use case priorities. Additionally, an employee learning and training pathway and an internal-communications plan are essential to drive the organization in the right direction.

Building the right team is crucial for successful gen AI implementation. A three-layered approach can be adopted. An action office should take ownership of the strategy and execution of initiatives. Cross-functional pods can be tasked with developing and implementing individual use cases. A technical foundation team should ensure the stability and security of the gen AI platform.

To make progress quickly, companies should initiate low-complexity use cases that can benefit from off-the-shelf gen AI tools. These initiatives will provide valuable insights into the potential of gen AI, the required talent and skills, and the operational model needed for scalability. Simultaneously, leaders in gen AI marketing should focus on building high-value use cases that are more complex and require customized solutions. Adjustments to gen AI foundation models may be necessary, and continuous testing and iteration based on user feedback will help inform deployment and scaling.

By following this three-tiered approach, companies can unleash the power of gen AI and leverage it to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and creativity in marketing. A potential timeline for implementation could include developing a pilot road map, launching a gen AI "win room" to define priority use cases, and then developing a long-term transformative AI strategy. Through consistent measurement of impact, change management, and fine-tuning of models, companies can integrate gen AI efforts with existing marketing technology and drive meaningful results.

Over time, marketers can expect to have a portfolio of public and democratically sourced use cases that showcase the power of gen AI. Workflow automation and gen AI will become vital tools in accelerating, improving, and simplifying marketing campaign journeys. Embrace gen AI now and embark on a forward-thinking marketing transformation.
