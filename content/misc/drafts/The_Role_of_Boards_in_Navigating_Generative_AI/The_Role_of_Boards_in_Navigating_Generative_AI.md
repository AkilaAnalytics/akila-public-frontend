title: The Role of Boards in Navigating Generative AI

Executives in companies are scrambling to understand and respond to the transformative potential of generative AI. The early success stories of using this technology are awe-inspiring, from generating code to answering complex questions and accelerating drug discovery. However, as the technology continues to evolve and get adopted at lightning speed, companies find themselves caught between the fear of being left behind and the fear of getting things wrong. It's crucial to unlock the value of generative AI while effectively managing its risks.

    To navigate these challenges, board members play a vital role in supporting their management teams. By asking the right questions, boards can guide companies in harnessing the potential power of generative AI thoughtfully yet decisively. Here are four broad questions boards should consider:

## How will generative AI affect our industry and company in the short and long term?
    Understanding the potential impact of generative AI on an industry and individual businesses is essential for formulating a sensible strategy. Research suggests that the first wave of applications will be in software engineering, marketing and sales, customer service, and product development. However, all industries should assess the potential value at stake for their company, as the technology and its adoption are moving rapidly. Immediate opportunities for efficiency improvement and explore further implications should be explored simultaneously.

## Are we balancing value creation with adequate risk management?
    Generative AI, like traditional AI, comes with its own set of risks that need to be managed. It raises privacy concerns, ethical risks, and the possibility of security breaches and infringement of legal protections. Companies must align the value and risks of each use case with their risk tolerance and other objectives. Legal and regulatory frameworks need to be established, and ongoing reviews, measures, and audits should be conducted. Processes to spot inaccuracies and mitigate risks, as well as considerations on employment and third-party usage, need to be thoughtfully addressed.

## How should we organize for generative AI?
    Given the speed of developments and the associated risks, a coordinated approach is crucial. Companies should appoint a senior executive responsible for overseeing and controlling all generative AI activities. A cross-functional team of senior individuals representing various business functions should collaborate to formulate and implement a strategy. Prioritizing high-impact use cases and establishing partnerships and alliances should also be part of the organizational design.

## Do we have the necessary capabilities?
    Companies need to review their technological capabilities, talent pool, and organizational culture to keep pace with generative AI. A modern data and tech stack, harmonized data access, a scalable data architecture, and upgraded infrastructure are essential. An assessment of talent needs and reskilling efforts, along with a focus on an innovative and learning culture, will ensure successful integration of generative AI.

    Board members themselves need to equip themselves to support their CEOs wisely. They can do so by understanding generative AI and its implications, either through adjusting board composition, training sessions, or hands-on experience. Generative AI is a rapidly evolving technological development, and boards must constructively challenge management teams, balancing innovation with caution.

    While these questions are a good starting point, the landscape of generative AI will continue to evolve. Boards hold the responsibility of ensuring wise and effective use of generative AI in the companies they oversee. It is through strategic questioning and action that companies can leverage the potential of generative AI while managing its risks, positioning themselves at the forefront of this technological advancement.
