subTitle: Unlocking the Power of Digital Transformation and AI
title: 'Closing the Gap: How Digital and AI Leaders are Pulling Ahead'
---

The digital and AI revolution is separating the winners from the losers. Recent studies show that the gap between companies with advanced digital and AI capabilities and those still lagging behind has grown by a staggering 60% in just three years. This significant difference in maturity and performance is measured through McKinsey's Digital Quotient (DQ) and AI Quotient (AIQ) assessments, which evaluate core capabilities and management practices essential for capturing value.

Unlike many companies that have struggled to achieve meaningful results from their digital transformation initiatives, leading companies are not only harnessing the power of digital and AI but also pulling further ahead of their competitors. This observation is based on data collected from over 20,000 individual respondents at more than 1,000 companies globally across various sectors.

The value of digital and AI capabilities is undeniable. Companies with advanced digital and AI capabilities consistently outperform their peers in terms of total shareholder returns (TSR) by two to six times across all sectors. This performance advantage is due to the compounding benefits that digital and AI provide when implemented effectively.

Leadership in digital and AI requires a holistic approach. Leading companies invest in a comprehensive set of hard-to-copy capabilities, which allow them to better target, pursue, and capture value repeatedly and consistently. These capabilities include a strategic roadmap aligned with top management, a talent pool of top technologists, a successful operating model that fosters collaboration and innovation, a distributed technology environment, a data architecture centered around reusable data products, and effective adoption and scaling processes.

While it may seem daunting, laggards can catch up by committing to the hard work of building these capabilities and rewiring their organizations. By focusing on where digital and AI innovations can have the greatest impact and developing the necessary capabilities, companies can make significant improvements in their digital maturity and increase EBIT by 10 to 20 percent within targeted domains in just two to three years.

A case study of a global consumer packaged goods (CPG) company showcases the power of rewiring a business with key digital and AI capabilities. By aligning leadership on three priority domains, managing performance through clear metrics, establishing strategic partnerships, and building technical and data capabilities, the company was able to move from the bottom tier of performers to making significant progress towards becoming a digital and AI leader. This transformation resulted in an increase of over $400 million in EBIT.

The time to act is now. The gap between digital and AI leaders and laggards will continue to widen as generative AI unlocks new capabilities. Companies that delay in building the necessary capabilities risk falling behind and facing significant challenges in remaining competitive. Embracing digital transformation and AI is not just a choice; it is a necessity for businesses that want to thrive in the age of disruption.
