Digital and AI capabilities have become essential for businesses to drive
sustainable growth and outperform their competitors. Our research shows that
companies with strong digital and AI capabilities consistently outperform their
peers, delivering two to six times higher total shareholder returns (TSR) across
every sector.

In recent years, the gap between digital and AI leaders and laggards has been
widening. Leaders continuously invest in improving their capabilities, creating
a compounding effect that sets them further apart from their competitors. The
distance between leaders and laggards has increased by 60% in the past three
years alone.

Leading companies understand that building a holistic set of hard-to-copy
capabilities is crucial for driving value and maintaining their competitive
advantage. Our analysis of over 200 digital and AI transformations revealed six
key areas where leaders excel:

1. Strategic road map: Leaders align top management around opportunities to
   improve performance through technology, committing to sustained investments
   for transformation.

2. Organization and talent: Leaders ensure they have a strong bench of digital
   talent who can rapidly iterate and deploy solutions while understanding
   business models and data.

3. Operating model: Leaders develop successful operating models that empower
   cross-functional teams to work autonomously on products and platforms.

4. Technology: Leaders create distributed technology environments that enable
   rapid innovation and easy access to data, applications, and software
   development tools.

5. Data: Leaders build robust data architectures centered around reusable data
   products, enabling teams to access and use data easily in different products.

6. Adoption and scaling: Leaders plan, resource, and govern change management
   from start to finish, driving broad adoption of new digital and AI products
   across the organization.

While leaders excel in each of these areas, they don't necessarily need to be
exceptional in all of them. However, hitting a baseline level of competency
across all areas is crucial as these capabilities are mutually reinforcing.

Businesses that have fallen behind can still catch up by focusing on deploying
digital and AI innovations strategically and building the necessary capabilities
to capture value quickly and consistently. Our research shows that companies
that commit to this level of change can see meaningful improvements in digital
maturity and increase their EBIT by 10 to 20% within two to three years.

One example is a global consumer packaged goods (CPG) company that transitioned
from a laggard to a leader by focusing on a few priority domains and aligning
their leadership around them. By building up their technical and data
capabilities, they were able to unlock new sources of value and increase their
EBIT by over $400 million.

The message is clear: rewiring a business with key digital and AI capabilities
is a true competitive advantage. Companies that delay building these
capabilities will struggle to catch up and remain competitive. The sooner
companies commit to building the right digital and AI capabilities, the sooner
they can start generating compounding growth and outperforming their
competitors.
