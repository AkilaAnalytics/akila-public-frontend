Every company desires to achieve maximum value and competitive advantage through the efficient scaling of artificial intelligence (AI). However, many organizations still struggle to grasp the importance of scaling AI across the entire company. By implementing a highly efficient AI production line, organizations can churn out dozens of reliable AI models, resulting in significant financial gains. Our research indicates that companies leveraging AI technology can potentially add up to 20 percent to their earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) while tapping into trillions of dollars in economic value.

While CEOs understand the need for cultural changes and mindset shifts to scale AI, they often overlook their role in creating a strategic vision for building, deploying, and managing AI applications efficiently. It is crucial for CEOs to recognize the value at stake and the possibilities that arise with the right technologies and practices. The current approach, characterized by bespoke and risk-laden AI applications, stems from outdated data science practices. Fortunately, recent advancements in AI tooling and technologies have transformed AI workflows, enabling consistent and reliable scaling of AI across business domains.

In this article, we will guide CEOs in understanding the integration of tools and practices that lead to efficient scaling of AI. By pulling the right levers, CEOs can support and facilitate their AI leaders' efforts in implementing these practices and technologies effectively.

The traditional approach of pursuing scattered pilots and building AI systems in silos is no longer viable. Companies leveraging AI technology must prioritize scaling efforts to keep up with market dynamics and consumer expectations. The roles, processes, and technologies required to achieve AI at scale have matured significantly. Specialized roles such as data engineers and machine learning engineers have emerged, equipped with the skills necessary for scaling AI operations.

MLOps, a blueprint for AI operations, combines platforms, tools, services, and roles with the right team operating model and standards. Derived from DevOps best practices, MLOps optimizes and automates the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring consistent delivery and raising the bar for what companies can achieve.

By implementing MLOps practices, organizations can experience productivity and speed improvements, embedding AI solutions organization-wide within a matter of weeks. Streamlining and automating processes, along with building reusable assets and components, are essential for achieving productivity and speed. Investing in reusable data products and modular components empowers teams to leverage data effectively and tailor AI solutions to specific use cases.

Reliability is another crucial aspect of efficient scaling. Companies often abandon AI solutions due to their inability to deliver value consistently. Comprehensive MLOps practices help companies shelve fewer models and increase the value they derive from AI work significantly. By integrating continuous monitoring and efficacy testing into workflows, organizations can ensure 24/7 operation of AI solutions. Establishing independent monitoring teams and automating key workflows contribute to stable and reliable deployment of AI applications.

Reducing risk is essential for regulatory compliance and establishing trust at scale. Despite investments in governance, many organizations lack visibility into the risks associated with their AI systems. By implementing MLOps practices, organizations can manage risks more effectively, ensuring compliance with regulations and building trust with stakeholders.

In conclusion, AI scaling is imperative for organizations aiming to optimize decision making, operations, and financial performance. CEOs play a vital role in creating a strategic vision for efficient scaling of AI applications. Embracing MLOps practices and leveraging the right technologies enable organizations to unlock the true potential of AI while ensuring productivity, reliability, risk management, and regulatory compliance. Companies must carefully consider the risks posed by their AI models and take proactive measures to mitigate these risks. The impact of AI models on daily decision-making, regulatory scrutiny, and potential damage to a company's reputation, operations, and finances cannot be underestimated. It is essential for companies to have a robust risk-management program supported by legal, risk, and AI professionals. These professionals can implement measures such as MLOps, which integrate comprehensive risk-mitigation strategies into the AI application life cycle. Through automated and continuous testing, MLOps can minimize manual errors and ensure the reliability of AI models. Additionally, the use of reusable components with clear documentation can reduce the probability of errors and facilitate updates across AI applications. For example, a financial-services company successfully utilized MLOps practices to document, validate, and audit its deployed models. This allowed them to understand the number of models in use, the data they depend on, and how they are governed. This knowledge enables risk teams to identify models sensitive to specific risks and address them appropriately, thus avoiding penalties and reputational damage.

Acquiring and retaining technical talent is crucial for scaling AI and analytics within companies. MLOps can serve as an attractive proposition for this talent by offering them opportunities to work with cutting-edge tools and tackle challenging analytics problems. Without a robust MLOps practice, top technical talent may become frustrated by mundane tasks that do not have a tangible impact on the business. Therefore, implementing MLOps practices can help organizations attract and retain critical talent.

Implementing MLOps requires significant cultural shifts within companies. It involves breaking down siloed ways of working and creating a factory-like environment for AI development and management. CEOs play a crucial role in facilitating these shifts. They need to set clear aspirations for impact and productivity, emphasizing that AI systems should operate at the same level as other business-critical systems. CEOs can champion key performance metrics such as the deployment and impact of AI models and the ability to identify risks and degradation in real-time. While achieving these goals may take time, prioritizing MLOps practices can lead to significant progress in just a few months.

Shared goals and joint accountability among business, AI, data, and IT teams are essential for measuring the impact of AI initiatives. Business leaders should have a clear understanding of the value they expect from AI, while AI and data teams should align their goals with those of the business. Collaboration on technology investments is also vital to optimize AI workflows and reduce complexity and technical debt. CEOs can accelerate the development of these partnerships by actively encouraging collaboration between AI and IT teams.

Investing in upskilling existing AI talent and creating new roles is crucial for successful implementation of MLOps. Data scientists, for example, need to evolve from low-level coding to possessing software engineering skills to build production-ready AI applications. New roles, such as machine learning engineers, are also emerging to ensure the reliability of AI systems in enterprise environments. Companies can combine internal expertise with external hires to build capable MLOps teams.

The value of AI is evident, but many organizations struggle to scale up due to inadequate operational practices, tools, and teams. MLOps can address this challenge by incorporating automated and simplified tools into AI development and management. CEOs, with their understanding of the benefits of MLOps and their ability to drive change, can play a pivotal role in promoting systematic AI development and management.
