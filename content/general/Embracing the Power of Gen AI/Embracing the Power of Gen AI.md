Technology is constantly evolving, transforming businesses in profound ways, and its pace is only accelerating. One of the latest technological advancements, generative AI (gen AI), is poised to bring about disruptive changes in various industries. While it won't impact all businesses simultaneously or equally, gen AI holds considerable potential for creating significant value.

Generative AI, unlike traditional analytical AI, has the ability to produce new, unstructured content such as text, images, and audio. It operates based on predictive language models and is designed to mimic human preferences and usefulness. However, it doesn't perform calculations or mathematical tasks like traditional AI. Instead, gen AI complements and coexists with analytical AI to enhance human lives and promote creativity and self-fulfillment.

As CFOs, it's crucial to allocate resources to projects that generate the most value for the enterprise, irrespective of whether they involve gen AI. It's not feasible to implement gen AI company-wide or in every aspect of the finance function. CFOs should carefully select a few use cases with the potential for meaningful impact. This article explores the most effective ways for CFOs to approach gen AI implementation, prioritize use cases, and quickly adapt to the learning curve.

To unlock the full potential of gen AI for enterprise-level value creation, CFOs must identify the most promising opportunities and ensure they receive adequate resources. However, the principles of finance and economics remain unchanged - companies need to generate returns above their cost of capital. Since capital is finite and projects compete against each other, CFOs should prioritize the 20 to 30 projects that will deliver the most substantial cash flows over the next decade.

When evaluating opportunities, CFOs should not dismiss gen AI initiatives solely because they lack familiarity with the technology or fail to recognize their value. In many cases, incorporating gen AI can significantly enhance revenue generation, reduce costs, or improve overall business performance. Microsoft and Morgan Stanley are notable examples of companies that have successfully leveraged gen AI to gain a competitive advantage.

Implementing gen AI also introduces new risks, which CFOs need to address proactively. Gen AI tools can sometimes produce inaccurate or nonsensical results, posing challenges in financial reporting and legal contexts. Privacy breaches, model bias, and the absence of human stress-testing are additional concerns. It's crucial to ensure that gen AI initiatives are properly funded and accompanied by robust risk management measures.

While it may seem unconventional for CFOs, seen primarily as "numbers people," to champion innovation, embracing gen AI is essential for achieving market-beating growth. CFOs should foster a culture of innovation within their teams, encourage exploration of gen AI opportunities, and actively engage with other stakeholders to understand project assumptions. By staying informed and continuously seeking information about opportunities and risks, CFOs can effectively allocate resources and establish risk guardrails.

For finance functions, gen AI will likely become an essential tool in the near future, saving time and resources. Embracing gen AI is part of the natural progression toward digital transformation. CFOs are not expected to be software experts but can initiate the process by experimenting with gen AI tools and gaining firsthand experience. Budgeting a nominal amount for learning purposes can further facilitate understanding and identification of practical use cases.

In conclusion, gen AI presents immense possibilities for value creation. CFOs have a pivotal role in driving its effective and responsible adoption within their organizations. By prioritizing high-value projects, managing risks, and embracing the power of gen AI, CFOs can position their finance functions and enterprises for success in the evolving landscape of technological innovation. Moving forward, it is important to recognize that gen AI cannot simply be implemented and left to its own devices. It is not a plug and play solution that can be applied to existing data sources without proper processing and curation. Unlike humans, gen AI does not create or have sudden moments of inspiration. Its purpose is to serve as a predictive language model that generates content to cater to human preferences.

To understand the impact of gen AI on finance functions, we have identified three major ways in which it can be utilized. First, through automation, gen AI can perform tedious tasks such as creating initial drafts of presentations. Second, through augmentation, it can enhance human productivity by gathering and synthesizing multiple pieces of information into a coherent narrative. Finally, through acceleration, gen AI can extract and index knowledge to expedite financial reporting cycles and promote innovation. By leveraging gen AI, CFOs can proactively manage performance and make informed business decisions.

To illustrate the potential of gen AI, multinational enterprises have already begun implementing various use cases. For example, gen AI can synthesize information and generate customizable interactive charts through natural-language queries. It can also provide digital performance management by answering performance-related questions, identifying root causes of budget variances, and suggesting resolutions. Additionally, gen AI can save time in preparing external reports by creating advanced first drafts and ensuring compliance with current regulations. Furthermore, it can assist in working capital management by facilitating collections and payments and assessing customer payment history risk.

The range of possibilities for gen AI is extensive and goes beyond theoretical applications. As adoption rates increase, it is crucial for CFOs to embrace gen AI and incorporate it into their strategies in a proactive manner. CFOs should view gen AI as a tool for value creation and actively support strategically critical initiatives by allocating necessary resources. It is also essential for CFOs to familiarize themselves and their teams with gen AI to stay ahead of the curve. The future is already here, and embracing gen AI is a key step towards success.
