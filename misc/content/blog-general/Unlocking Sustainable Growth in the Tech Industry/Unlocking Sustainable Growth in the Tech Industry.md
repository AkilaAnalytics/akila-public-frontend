The tech industry is standing at a crucial crossroad. While tech companies have redefined innovation and experienced remarkable growth, they now face increasing pressure from investors to pursue sustainable growth. To achieve this, tech companies need to prioritize cash flows, cost reductions, productivity enhancements, and a better customer experience. However, these endeavors require effective data management practicesâ€”a critical element that many tech companies struggle with.

In order to unlock sustainable growth, tech companies can focus on four data-driven levers. First, transforming business models by shifting towards service models that generate stable cash flows. This requires improved data-integration capabilities and the aggregation of data for on-demand access. Second, proactively managing internal costs by identifying critical data use cases and optimizing them to reduce expenses across the value chain. Data-driven insights can help identify cost-saving opportunities and optimize resource allocation. Third, raising productivity by identifying process bottlenecks and implementing robotic process automation (RPA) to free up capacity. Proper data management is crucial for the success of RPA initiatives. Lastly, improving data security and privacy to enhance the customer experience and avoid penalties and breaches that can damage a company's reputation.

To effectively implement these levers, tech companies need to transition into data-driven organizations. This involves creating a central repository of internal data and curated data products that increase availability without compromising speed. Tech companies should also establish a data governance program to ensure data security and enforce advanced data governance processes and tools. Lastly, launching "data quality at scale" programs can help address the common roadblock of poor data quality by using AI tech solutions, implementing incentive models, and enforcing quality controls at the data generation stage.

By embracing these strategies and becoming data-driven organizations, tech companies can seize the opportunities for sustainable growth, adapt to new business models, improve efficiency, and meet the increasing demands for data security from customers. It is a pivotal moment for tech companies to invest in their internal data initiatives and drive long-term success.
