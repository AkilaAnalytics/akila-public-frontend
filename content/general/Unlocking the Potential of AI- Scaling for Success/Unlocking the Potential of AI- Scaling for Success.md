What if a company built each component of its product from scratch with every order, without any standardized or consistent parts, processes, and quality-assurance protocols? Chances are that any CEO would view such an approach as a major red flag preventing economies of scale and introducing unacceptable levels of risk—and would seek to address it immediately.

Yet every day this is how many organizations approach the development and management of artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics in general, putting themselves at a tremendous competitive disadvantage. Significant risk and inefficiencies are introduced as teams scattered across an enterprise regularly start efforts from the ground up, working manually without enterprise mechanisms for effectively and consistently deploying and monitoring the performance of live AI models.

Ultimately, for AI to make a sizable contribution to a company’s bottom line, organizations must scale the technology across the organization, infusing it in core business processes, workflows, and customer journeys to optimize decision making and operations daily. Achieving such scale requires a highly efficient AI production line, where every AI team quickly churns out dozens of race-ready, risk-compliant, reliable models. Companies that adopt such an approach are much more likely to realize scale and value, adding as much as 20 percent to their earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) through their use of AI and tapping into the $9 trillion to $15 trillion in economic value potential the technology offers.

CEOs often recognize their role in providing strategic pushes around the cultural changes, mindset shifts, and domain-based approaches necessary to scale AI. However, few recognize their role in setting a strategic vision for the organization to build, deploy, and manage AI applications with speed and efficiency. Understanding the value at stake and what’s possible with the right technologies and practices is the first step toward taking this active role.

In recent years, massive improvements in AI tooling and technologies have dramatically transformed AI workflows, expediting the AI application life cycle and enabling consistent and reliable scaling of AI across business domains. A best-in-class framework for ways of working, often called MLOps (short for "machine learning operations"), now can enable organizations to take advantage of these advances and create a standard, company-wide AI "factory" capable of achieving scale.

In this article, we'll help CEOs understand how MLOps tools and practices come together and identify the right levers they can pull to support and facilitate their AI leaders' efforts to put these practices and technologies firmly in place.

The bar for AI keeps rising. Gone are the days when organizations could afford to take a strictly experimental approach to AI and analytics broadly, pursuing scattered pilots and a handful of disparate AI systems built in silos. Organizations recognizing the value of AI have rapidly shifted gears from exploring what the technology can do to exploiting it at scale to achieve maximum value.

Thankfully, as AI has matured, so too have roles, processes, and technologies designed to drive its success at scale. MLOps has arisen as a blueprint for combining these platforms, tools, services, and roles with the right team operating model and standards for delivering AI reliably and at scale. MLOps draws from existing software-engineering best practices, called DevOps, which have enabled faster delivery of more robust, risk-compliant software in many technology companies. MLOps is poised to do the same in the AI space by extending DevOps to address AI's unique characteristics.

To understand the business impact of end-to-end MLOps, it is helpful to examine the potential improvements from four essential angles: productivity and speed, reliability, risk, and talent acquisition and retention. Inefficiencies in any of these areas can choke an organization’s ability to achieve scale.

Companies applying MLOps can go from idea to a live solution in just two to 12 weeks without increasing headcount or technical debt, reducing time to value and freeing teams to scale AI faster. Achieving productivity and speed requires streamlining and automating processes, as well as building reusable assets and components that are managed closely for quality and risk.

Enhancing reliability is crucial to ensure the 24/7 operation of AI solutions. Companies using comprehensive MLOps practices shelve 30 percent fewer models and increase the value they realize from their AI work by as much as 60 percent. By integrating continuous monitoring and efficacy testing of models into their workflows, organizations can create always-on AI systems that deliver reliable results.

Reducing risk is essential to ensure regulatory compliance and trust at scale. Companies must implement MLOps practices that include independent monitoring and validation of results to detect and solve issues promptly. By moving monitoring and management to specialized operations teams, organizations can reduce the burden on those developing new AI solutions and maintain a focus on bringing new AI capabilities to end users.

In conclusion, scaling AI within organizations requires the adoption of MLOps practices and technologies. By building a highly efficient AI production line and leveraging MLOps frameworks, companies can achieve scale, increase value, and tap into the immense economic potential of AI. It is crucial for CEOs to understand the value at stake and actively support and facilitate the implementation of MLOps within their organizations to unlock the full potential of AI. Companies must be aware of the risks associated with their AI models and take necessary steps to mitigate them. Given the significant role AI models play in decision making, the increase in regulatory scrutiny, and the potential damage caused by system malfunctions or biases, it is crucial to have a robust risk management program in place. This program should involve collaboration between legal, risk, and AI professionals.

To effectively manage these risks, it is essential to incorporate comprehensive risk mitigation measures into the AI application life cycle. MLOps, for example, can help reduce manual errors through automated and continuous testing. By using reusable components with well-documented structures, usage guidelines, and risk considerations, the probability of errors is minimized, and updates can easily be applied across AI applications.

A financial-services company that implemented MLOps practices has successfully documented, validated, and audited deployed models. This approach allows the risk teams to identify models that may be sensitive to specific risks and demonstrate how they are addressing those risks to regulators. By doing so, they can avoid heavy penalties and reputational damage.

When it comes to implementing AI at scale, talent retention and acquisition become critical factors. Many companies face challenges in finding the necessary technical talent. However, a robust MLOps practice can serve as an attractive proposition for top talent. Technical professionals are drawn to the opportunity of working with cutting-edge tools and solving challenging analytics problems. Without a well-established MLOps practice, companies risk frustrating their top talent with transactional tasks that do not have a tangible business impact.

Implementing MLOps requires significant cultural shifts within organizations. It is essential to move away from siloed ways of working and create a factory-like environment around AI development and management. CEOs play a crucial role in this transformation by setting clear aspirations, facilitating shared goals and accountability, and investing in talent.

CEOs can break down organizational barriers by vocalizing company values and expectations. They should emphasize the need for developing, delivering, and maintaining AI systems that generate sustainable value. CEOs can champion key performance metrics such as the percentage of deployed models delivering value, the total impact and ROI from AI, and the ability to identify model degradation and risks in near-real-time.

Shared goals and joint accountability between business leaders and AI, data, and IT teams are crucial for success. Business leaders should articulate the value they expect from AI, while AI teams should align their goals with business objectives. Collaboration around strategic technology investments is also vital to optimize AI workflows and balance short-term fixes with long-term considerations.

Investing in upskilling existing AI talent and creating new roles is another important aspect of implementing MLOps. Data scientists, for example, need to possess knowledge of software engineering to build production-ready AI applications. Additionally, roles such as machine learning engineers, who specialize in turning AI models into reliable production systems, are emerging.

As AI becomes more integrated into businesses, it is essential to have the right operational practices, tools, and teams in place. MLOps can help companies incorporate technological innovations and proven software engineering practices, enabling the development of reliable AI systems. CEOs, with their understanding of MLOps and ability to facilitate systematic AI development and management, can drive this transformation.
