Generative AI (Gen AI) is poised to transform the real estate industry by leveraging vast amounts of data to customize tools for real estate-specific tasks and open up new possibilities for investors, designers, and marketers. With its open-ended and creative nature, Gen AI introduces a fresh chance for real estate companies to break away from traditional practices and embrace technology's cutting edge.

For decades, AI has been reshaping businesses in various industries, but real estate has been slow to adopt these technologies. However, Gen AI presents an opportunity for the industry to learn from the past and reinvent itself. According to the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), Gen AI could generate over $110 billion to $180 billion in value for the real estate industry.

Despite the hype surrounding Gen AI, many real estate organizations struggle to implement and scale use cases, hindering them from realizing the promised value creation. Deriving competitive advantage from Gen AI requires more than just deploying foundational models; it necessitates a comprehensive approach to harness its full potential.

To help companies get started on their Gen AI journey, this article explores the technology's potential and provides real-world examples of its use cases in the real estate industry. Additionally, it outlines seven pivotal actions that real estate companies can take to unlock the full value of Gen AI and gain a strategic edge over their peers.

Real estate companies can leverage Gen AI in a multitude of use cases, categorized as "the four Cs": customer engagement, creation, concision, and coding solutions. By deploying tools such as conversational chatbots, businesses can enhance customer engagement and remove doubt from decision-making processes. Gen AI can also generate new creative content, synthesize insights from unstructured data, and assist with coding tasks.

In our work with AI, we have witnessed real estate companies achieve significant improvements, including a net operating income increase of over 10%, stronger customer experiences, higher tenant retention rates, new revenue streams, and smarter asset selection. Five examples illustrate how businesses can apply Gen AI's four Cs to specific real estate challenges:

1. Sifting through leasing documentation: Gen AI can summarize key themes across leases, providing professionals with valuable insights and generating tables of information.

2. Copiloting real estate interactions: A Gen AI-powered bot can manage tenant requests and lease negotiations, improve communication, and even create negotiation transcripts.

3. Enabling visualization and creating new revenue streams: Gen AI tools can help potential tenants visualize customized spaces and facilitate e-commerce tie-ins, enhancing the prospect-to-lease conversion process and generating new revenue streams.

4. Making faster, more precise investment decisions: Gen AI tools can analyze internal and third-party data to provide investment recommendations based on specific criteria, streamlining decision-making processes.

5. Drawing architectural plans known to create desired outcomes: Gen AI-assisted designs can optimize space based on user data and desired outcomes, improving sales, customer loyalty, and productivity.

Real estate companies aiming to fully unlock the value of Gen AI must go beyond deploying off-the-shelf products. Alignment within the C-suite is critical, with CEOs taking the lead in prioritizing technology, onboarding new capabilities, and embracing agile delivery methodologies. Embracing experimentation, iteration, and self-disruption is vital for staying ahead of the curve.

Real estate organizations should invest in a dedicated team of engineers and designers familiar with Gen AI to focus on value-adding use cases. Furthermore, C-suites should reimagine their roles, structures, and traditional hierarchies to facilitate the adoption of Gen AI throughout the organization.

By embracing Gen AI and implementing these pivotal actions, real estate companies can position themselves at the forefront of technology and elevate their performance across the value chain.

Companies must shift their focus to prioritize data and consider what proprietary data they can collect to gain a competitive advantage. Having the best data set is not enough; it must also be engineered and governed properly.

Traditional interaction channels, such as tenant apps and dashboards, are not just means of communication, they can also serve as valuable data sources. Understanding what residential tenants book, what shoppers browse, or what services office tenants require can provide valuable insights that can be leveraged.

To maximize the potential of gen AI models, it is crucial to engineer a prompt library tailored to the real estate industry. By fine-tuning the prompts, companies can obtain significantly different outputs with meaningful impact. Testing and refining the prompts is essential to ensure that they return expected answers.

While large language models may provide comprehensible responses, additional digital tools are often needed to make the outputs useful to an organization. This can include grammar and brand compliance checks, as well as design considerations for conversational systems. Design must expand to accommodate the psychology of interactions with algorithms and machines.

Building a modern technology stack is vital to enable the effective use of gen AI. This includes implementing toxicity checks and guardrails to ensure compliance with fair-housing and antidiscrimination laws and prevent false answers. Real estate companies that embrace early proofs of concept and connect data across various systems will be best positioned to benefit.

The adoption of gen AI may require a redesign of operating models and job roles to align with new focus points of work. Companies should be open to change and explore new roles and capabilities that gen AI tools can offer. Recognizing and mitigating risks unique to real estate is crucial, such as biases in training data and questions regarding intellectual properties.

While gen AI presents unique challenges, it also offers game-changing solutions for the real estate industry. The technology has matured and now provides opportunities that were previously unimaginable. By investing in technology, restructuring operating models, and embracing gen AI, real estate companies can overcome these challenges and emerge as leaders in the field.

Data will be the new battleground for businesses competing for investors, tenants, buyers, and long-term success. While getting started may seem daunting, executives are encouraged to take a simple approach and identify two use cases to kickstart their data ownership journey. This approach allows companies to deliver measurable impact quickly while also working towards more transformative initiatives.

The real estate industry is undergoing significant changes, and companies must decide whether to adapt and embrace a digitally powered future or be left behind. The time to act is now, and the potential benefits of gen AI are worth the investment and effort required.
