## An Unlikely Duo: Private Equity & Data Science 

#### How did data science and alternative data seep into an industry driven by traditional analysis? 

In recent years, the realms of data science and private equity (PE) have witnessed an intertwining evolution. As the 
PE landscape matures, returns have been driven down, it has become imperative to embrace advanced methods to uncover 
hidden value. The age of traditional analyses, while still the primary form of analysis, it needs to be supplemented. 
The concurrent ascent of data science is no coincidence; its ability to analyze vast arrays of structured and unstructured 
data and discern patterns gives early adopters a strategic advantage.  

Why has data science become an inextricable component of PE? The answer lies in the industry's evolution. 
The incorporation of alternative data sources or non-financial data (e.g. analyzing an operating company’s internal datasets)
is no longer a luxury but a necessity in making informed investment decisions. Many PE firms are now actively engaging 
in the operations of their portfolio companies. This involvement paves the way for data science to play a pivotal role. 
By leveraging data-driven insights, portfolio companies can streamline their operations, drive customer growth, and 
optimize supply chains to make informed strategic decisions, and significantly enhance their overall efficiency.  

 
According to a recent survey by [Lowenstein & Sander](https://www.lowenstein.com/media/11867/2022-alternative-data-report-final.pdf),
“Nearly 80 percent of current users plan to increase their 2023 
budgets for alternative data”. For context, the alternative data industry is set to grow from $4.5 billion to $149 billion, a 
CAGR of 55% from 2022 to 2030. A surprising result of this trend is that private equity firms now outpace hedge funds for alternative data: 
“On average, private equity firms spend slightly more than hedge funds do—$1.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively.” 
 
## The Human Touch
However, as with any powerful tool, the intersection of data science and PE has its challenges. 
Ensuring data integrity is paramount; even the most sophisticated algorithms falter when fed flawed data. 
A more difficult task will be bridging the gap between data scientist and portfolio manager. 
Like any analysis, the results of analytics workflows are often nuanced and based off a specific set of assumptions. 
Ensuring everyone across a deal-team is aligned will be critical to ensure no unexpected risks are incurred.  

Moreover, there's a lurking danger in over-relying on data-driven models. We must remember that data is a reflection of the past 
and present, and while it can provide predictive insights, it can't account for unprecedented events or shifts. 
Lastly, human judgment remains indispensable. An algorithm might suggest the most optimal path, but it lacks the 
human element of understanding stakeholder sentiments, cultural nuances, and the intricacies of market behavior. 
Pairing machine insights with human judgment yields the best results.  

## Going Forward 
The trajectory of private equity is unmistakably directed towards a future intertwined with data science. 
As leaders in the space, we must not view this as a mere trend but as the next frontier in maximizing value. 
It beckons us to continually adapt, learn, and lead the way. This isn't just the future—it's our present, redefined.
