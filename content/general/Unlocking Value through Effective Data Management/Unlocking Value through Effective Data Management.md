In today's competitive landscape, organizations must adopt a proactive approach to data management in order to drive success. To unlock the full potential of their data investments, companies should shift their focus towards managing data as a consumer product. This innovative approach enables businesses to not only extract immediate value, but also lays the foundation for future growth.

Traditional grassroots and big-bang data strategies have proven to be ineffective and costly. The grassroots approach involves fragmented data collection efforts by individual teams, leading to duplication of work and complex technology architectures. On the other hand, the big-bang strategy relies on a centralized team to extract, cleanse, and aggregate data en masse. While it reduces rework, it often fails to align with specific business use cases and lacks the necessary governance and quality standards.

To address these shortcomings, managing data as a product offers a more efficient and streamlined solution. Data products provide organizations with comprehensive, ready-to-use datasets that can be easily accessed and applied to different business challenges. Whether it's gaining a 360-degree view of customers, employees, product lines, or branches, or leveraging digital twins to replicate real-world assets, data products offer a versatile and efficient approach.

These data products are designed to meet the unique requirements of different business systems, ensuring seamless integration and consumption. By incorporating the necessary wiring for various digital apps and reporting systems, data products eliminate the need for teams to spend valuable time searching for and processing data. This not only improves efficiency but also reduces costs and governance challenges associated with maintaining bespoke data sets and pipelines.

Implementing data products requires a dedicated approach to management and funding. Each data product should have a dedicated product manager and a team of skilled data professionals, including engineers, architects, and modelers. These teams should be integrated within a data utility group, allowing them to collaborate with subject matter experts and receive valuable user feedback. Furthermore, organizations should establish standards and best practices for building data products, ensuring consistency and scalability across the organization.

To ensure continuous improvement and alignment with business needs, data product teams should track performance using relevant metrics such as user satisfaction scores, product reuse, and return on investment. Quality assurance is also crucial, as data integrity and security are paramount. Data product teams should work closely with data stewards to define and maintain data definitions, ensuring appropriate governance for each use case.

In conclusion, managing data as a product offers a proactive and efficient approach to data management. By leveraging data products, organizations can unlock immediate value, reduce costs, and pave the way for future growth. It's time for companies to embrace this innovative strategy and capitalize on the full potential of their data investments.
