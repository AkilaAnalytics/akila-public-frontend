Organizations often struggle to extract maximum value from their data
investments. Traditional grassroots and big-bang data strategies have proven to
be inadequate in delivering real results. However, by adopting a new approach
and treating data like a consumer product, companies can unlock immediate value
while paving the way for future opportunities.

Introducing data products, the key to transforming data strategy. These products
deliver high-quality, readily-accessible data sets that can be applied to
various business challenges. By providing a comprehensive view of important
entities or replicating real-world assets, data products empower organizations
to make data-driven decisions effectively.

What sets data products apart is their ability to accommodate different business
systems and consumption archetypes. These pre-wired products eliminate the need
for extensive data processing and customization, saving time and effort. As a
result, organizations can deliver new business use cases up to 90 percent faster
and reduce total cost of ownership by 30 percent.

To succeed with data products, a dedicated management and funding structure is
crucial. Each product should have a product manager supported by a diverse team
of data experts who continuously improve the product and enable new use cases.
Additionally, establishing standards, measuring performance, and ensuring data
quality are essential for long-term success.

By embracing data product management, organizations can unlock the full
potential of their data investments. To learn more about this transformative
approach, read our comprehensive article, "A Better Way to Put Your Data to
Work," on hbr.org.
