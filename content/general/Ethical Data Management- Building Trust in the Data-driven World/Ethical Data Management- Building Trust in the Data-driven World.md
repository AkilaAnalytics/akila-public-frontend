The era of data is here, and it's more essential than ever for businesses to embrace ethical data management practices. With the global production of data reaching unprecedented levels, companies must recognize the need to address both the operational and ethical aspects of data management. Neglecting the ethical implications of data use can have severe consequences, including reputational damage, financial costs, and even personal liability for board members.

To navigate this landscape successfully, business leaders need to start thinking about ethical data management and take proactive measures to ensure responsible practices across the entire value chain. In our conversations with global business leaders and data ethics experts, we discovered common traps that organizations fall into when it comes to data management. These traps include underestimating the importance of data ethics, relying solely on legal and compliance teams, and overlooking the role of data scientists.

To avoid these pitfalls, companies should consider adopting new standards for data management, reimagining governance models, and promoting collaboration across disciplines and organizations. While our research does not cover all possible challenges, it highlights the urgent need for sustained attention to data ethics from the entire C-suite, especially the CEO.

## What is ethical data use?

Ethical data use revolves around preserving data security, protecting customer information, providing clear benefits to consumers and companies, and empowering customers with agency. It also requires companies to fulfill the promises they make to their customers, stakeholders, and partners.

Cybersecurity and data privacy should be viewed as integral parts of data ethics, and organizations have an ethical responsibility to protect customer data and defend against breaches. Data-based transactions should offer clear benefits to consumers, whether it's speed, convenience, value, or savings. Customers should also have a say in how their data is used, and organizations should avoid surprises or hidden consent in data-driven interactions. By keeping faith with stakeholders, companies can build trust and credibility.

## Overcoming common challenges

Our discussions with business leaders revealed some common challenges and unintended lapses in data ethics. First, many executives mistakenly believe that data ethics doesn't apply to their organization, focusing instead on visible aspects of data management. Second, some companies rely solely on legal, compliance, or data science teams for data ethics, overlooking the need for broader involvement across the organization. Third, short-term ROI pressures can lead to unethical data choices, jeopardizing long-term trust. Finally, organizations must consider the entire data pipeline and ensure that data sources and vendors adhere to ethical practices.

## Building a foundation for ethical data management

As organizations grapple with these challenges, several key principles can guide the development of robust and ethical data management programs. 

1. **Set company-specific rules for data usage**: Leaders from various business units and functions, along with legal and compliance teams, should collaborate to create a shared data usage framework. These rules should reflect the company's risk threshold and ensure alignment with customers' expectations and regulatory requirements.

2. **Communicate your data values**: Once data usage rules are established, effective internal and external communication is crucial. Organizations should make data ethics a visible part of their culture by featuring data values on employees' screens and tailoring messaging to different teams. Publicizing the company's data ethics framework can also help build trust and accountability with external stakeholders.

These building blocks provide a starting point for organizations to develop ethical data management practices. However, as data continues to grow and technologies evolve, new challenges will emerge, requiring constant adaptation and innovation. By embracing ethical data management and prioritizing responsible practices, companies can navigate the data-driven world while building trust with their customers and stakeholders.

The implementation of powerful collective action, such as the establishment of industry-wide standards for data ethics, is gaining significant momentum. Discover why digital trust is of utmost importance by reading our survey findings. In order to develop a robust data ethics program, organizations of all sizes must allocate dedicated resources to address ethical issues. This should not be treated as a secondary activity; rather, it requires the formation of a specialized team or the assignment of responsibility to a specific role. Notably, some larger companies in the technology and pharmaceutical sectors have appointed chief ethics or chief trust officers in recent years. Additionally, interdisciplinary teams, often referred to as data ethics boards, have been established to define and uphold data ethics. Ideally, these boards should include representatives from various business units, such as marketing, sales, compliance and legal, audit, IT, and the C-suite. Furthermore, it is crucial that these boards consist of members with diverse backgrounds, including gender, race, ethnicity, and social class. This diversity facilitates the early identification of issues, such as those related to algorithm-training data, by incorporating a wide range of perspectives.

A multinational financial-services corporation has successfully devised a structure for their data ethics deliberations and decision-making processes. This organization relies on two primary data ethics groups. Major decisions are made by a group of senior stakeholders comprising the head of security, senior technology executives, the chief privacy officer, the head of the consulting arm, the head of strategy, and the heads of brand, communications, and digital advertising. These individuals are the ones most likely to utilize the data. Another group, chaired by the chief privacy officer and including the global head of data, a senior risk executive, and the executive responsible for the company's brand, focuses on governance. Any new data-related proposals are referred to this council, and teams are required to demonstrate compliance with the company's data use principles. It is crucial for both of these bodies to be cross-functional, as this approach ensures a comprehensive perspective on data ethics, as explained by a senior company executive.

While compliance teams and legal counsel are not solely responsible for considering a company's data ethics, they play a significant role in ensuring the success of data ethics programs. Legal experts possess the expertise necessary to advise on the application of existing and emerging regulations to the company's practices. However, organizations may also benefit from engaging external experts to navigate complex ethical challenges. For example, a large tech company sought the assistance of an academic expert on AI ethics to address gray areas, such as the environmental impact of certain data use practices. This expert participated fully in the decision-making process, leading the team's work while participating in every meeting as a non-voting member.

Engaging key stakeholders in the C-suite is instrumental in building a culture that prioritizes data ethics. Several practitioners and experts who have established data ethics boards emphasized the significance of keeping the CEO and corporate board informed about decisions and activities. While the CEO may not be directly involved in decision-making, presenting data ethics conclusions to the CEO ensures alignment and agreement on the organization's stance. Having influential champions at the C-suite level sends a powerful message about the importance of data ethics, reinforces compliance with data rules, and bolsters the case for investment in data-related initiatives. Furthermore, corporate boards and audit committees play a vital role in upholding data ethics by providing necessary checks and balances, irrespective of conflicting incentives. Adding a data ethics report to the audit committee's agenda, for instance, highlights the organization's commitment to data ethics and ensures accountability.

The impact of algorithms and overall data use should be continuously assessed and diligently monitored for bias throughout the value chain. Organizations must consider the potential negative consequences, even unintended, that may arise from the development of AI products. It is crucial to address questions of whether algorithms perpetuate sexism or racism. For data applications with higher stakes, such as security, organizations should implement additional measures to prevent biases. For instance, an organization offering image and video recognition products and services for security purposes took significant steps to ensure fair treatment by debiasing the datasets. The analysis of data usage should not only focus on the types of data utilized but also on examining current and potential future uses.

Successfully navigating data ethics requires organizations to consider the interests and perspectives of individuals who are not present in decision-making processes. This global perspective is essential to uphold ethical standards in data use. Leaders must adopt a broad view of their organizations in the digital economy, data ecosystem, and societies worldwide. They can contribute to policy initiatives, bridge the digital divide, support the expansion of broadband infrastructure, and foster diversity in the tech industry. Ultimately, data ethics necessitates grappling with the increasing global inequality and the concentration of wealth and value in certain tech hubs and among AI-enabled organizations.

Establishing data usage rules and defining ethical data use is just the first step. It is equally important to integrate these rules into the daily operations of the organization. Data ethics boards, business unit leaders, and C-suite champions should collaborate to develop a shared understanding and language around the connection between data usage rules, the company's data and corporate strategies, and real-world applications of data ethics, such as decision-making processes for design or M&A. Operationalizing data ethics can occur in various departments, such as data operations teams, secure-development operations teams, and machine-learning operations teams. Trust-building frameworks for machine-learning operations should ensure that data ethics are considered at every stage of AI application development. To ensure the ethical use of data becomes ingrained in daily work, the leadership team should advocate for and facilitate formal training programs on data ethics. Implementing effective data ethics practices takes time and effort. Building teams, establishing practices, and transforming organizational culture are challenges that leaders must navigate. Upholding data ethics principles may require foregoing partnerships and opportunities for short-term revenue generation, but it is vital for companies. Organizations that neglect to prioritize data ethics risk losing the trust of customers and undermining their value.
