subTitle: The Future of Analytics in Financial Institutions
title: Transforming Risk Modeling and Model Risk Management
---

Financial institutions have embraced new analytics capabilities to thrive in the face of rising uncertainty, volatility, and event risks. This has led to the transformation of risk modeling and model risk management (MRM) across the industry. Through our extensive discussions with risk managers, we have identified three key transformations that will shape institutional approaches in the coming year.

Firstly, banks are focusing on efficiency, digitization, and automation of the model life cycle to effectively manage their expanding model inventories. The process of model validation remains a challenge, with significant time and resource requirements. To address this, banks are optimizing processes, reducing overlaps, and embracing risk-based approaches to improve the efficiency of the MRM function. Automation has become a top priority, offering benefits such as increased consistency, rigor, and efficiency. However, many banks are still in the early stages of automation implementation, with room for further progress.

Secondly, the scope of MRM is expanding beyond traditional areas to include emerging risks such as climate, cyber, sales and marketing, and even human resources. Banks are recalibrating their organizational setups and expanding mandates to accommodate these new areas of focus. This includes investments in new toolkits and validation approaches to support risk management activities. Many banks have centralized their MRM and validation functions, with increased oversight at senior levels. The incorporation of model risk in broader risk appetite assessments further highlights the growing importance of MRM.

Lastly, banks are prioritizing derisking and capitalizing on the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data. AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning techniques have enabled banks to analyze larger data sets and ask more nuanced questions in areas such as financial crime compliance, cyber risk, and sales and marketing. Banks are actively managing the risks associated with AI and ML through enhanced model governance, validation frameworks, and training. Regulatory focus on ethical and reputational risks related to complex models has also intensified.

In summary, financial institutions are undergoing significant transformations in risk modeling and MRM. The focus is on efficiency, digitization, and automation of the model life cycle, expanding the scope of MRM, and maximizing the potential of AI/ML and big data. These strategic and tactical adjustments will define the future of MRM in the year ahead. We have seen a significant increase in efforts to enhance AI/ML model definitions, demonstrating our powerful knowledge capabilities. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed. Many organizations are struggling with AI validation standards and tools, as well as a shortage of AI talent. Additionally, there are practical challenges in the use of AI, particularly in industries such as financial crime compliance and climate modeling.

To address these challenges, it is crucial for organizations to pay close attention to their regulatory obligations, such as the European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation. Regulators often lack the necessary frameworks and expertise to fully assess new AI models, which highlights the importance of a flexible approach to validation in order to keep up with the rapidly evolving landscape.

Furthermore, the lack of historical data in AI use cases can inhibit comparability. As such, validation approaches may require flexibility and pragmatism, recognizing that AI models and calibration frequencies differ from traditional models. Agile approaches have proven to be a good match for the novelty of AI use cases.

The number of AI models being utilized varies across banks globally, with some using a significant number while others prefer a smaller range. However, in Europe, there is a growing trend towards developing and validating at least ten AI/ML models within the next two years.

The emergence of AI and its use cases has presented unique challenges that can be described as "cultural." Organizations must adopt an agile and interactive engagement model, involving support functions such as legal and IT from the outset. It is crucial to establish a dedicated support structure and secure strong sponsorship. A tailored risk-based approach to validation and review is also essential. Additionally, there is a need to foster validation awareness among modeling teams, many of which lack familiarity with validation protocols.

For MRM teams, defining explainability requirements for the first line of defense (LoD) and enhancing monitoring standards is a primary role. Large banks often benchmark AI/ML models against simpler approaches. While banks have made progress in updating their model definitions, providing guidelines to the first LoD, and renewing their governance frameworks, there are still gaps in coverage. For example, most banks do not have defined roles for assessing bias.

Looking ahead, our top priorities are to enhance our MRM framework capabilities, including risk culture, standards, and procedures, and to upgrade our validation resources. We are focused on achieving "MRM 2.0," which means improving reporting and key performance indicators (KPIs), strengthening risk appetite frameworks, and embedding good governance and the right culture. It is crucial for decision makers at senior levels to fully understand the potential risks and impacts of models and analytics. These efforts will be supported by increased efficiency through digitization, an empowered MRM function, and advancements in AI utilization. Despite the uncertainties of the future, there is both work to be done and ample opportunity for growth.
