If your business is not ready for generative AI, then it is not ready for the future. The advantages and economic potential of generative AI are immense, with estimates suggesting that it could add trillions of dollars to the global economy. To harness this potential, businesses need to prioritize data and its underlying foundations.

Managing data is already a top challenge for organizations looking to scale AI use cases. Chief data officers (CDOs) face the daunting task of navigating the ever-changing landscape of generative AI. However, through our extensive work and collaborations, we have identified seven key actions that data leaders can take to drive successful outcomes in generative AI.

1. Let value be your guide: CDOs must prioritize value and understand the data implications of their overall approach to generative AI. They need to assess whether their business fits the Taker, Shaper, or Maker archetype and focus on initiatives that deliver the broadest benefits.

2. Build specific capabilities into the data architecture: The scope of value in generative AI has expanded due to its ability to work with unstructured data. CDOs need to strengthen the data architecture's foundations and prioritize upgrades that enable high-value use cases. This includes improving unstructured data stores, data preprocessing, vector databases, LLM integrations, and prompt engineering.

3. Focus on key points of the data life cycle: Ensuring high-quality data is crucial for generative AI success. CDOs must extend data observability programs to identify quality issues and implement interventions at the source data, preprocessing, prompt, and output stages to maintain data integrity.

4. Protect sensitive data and adapt to evolving regulations: With generative AI introducing new security risks, data leaders must prioritize data privacy and security. They should proactively protect proprietary and personal information while adapting quickly to emerging regulations.

By taking these actions, businesses can harness the transformative power of generative AI and unlock its full potential. Data leaders play a critical role in driving success and should prioritize value, data architecture capabilities, data quality, and data security to pave the way for a successful generative AI implementation.

Unlock the value of generative AI, and propel your business into the future of AI-driven innovation.

In today's rapidly evolving landscape, security and risk have become hot topics in the realm of generative AI. It is essential for CDOs to shift their focus to the data implications in three specific areas. This includes identifying and prioritizing security risks to proprietary data within the enterprise. By assessing the broader risks associated with sharing confidential and proprietary code with generative AI models, CDOs can effectively prioritize the most significant threats. Data protection and cybersecurity governance methods can be extended to address specific risks through the implementation of pop-up reminders and automated scripts to ensure compliance.

In addition to this, CDOs must take charge of managing access to personally identifiable information (PII) data. Implementing systems that incorporate protective tools and human interventions will ensure the removal of PII data during the preprocessing phase and prior to its usage on a large language model (LLM). The use of synthetic data and nonsensitive identifiers can also aid in data regulation within the context of generative AI.

Keeping a close watch on the surge of regulations is of utmost importance. Governments worldwide are enacting new standards, such as the European Union's AI Act. Comprehending these regulations and their implications for data strategy is vital for data leaders. Staying in sync with risk leaders within the business is key to understanding and implementing necessary actions, such as "untraining" models that utilize regulated data.

As enterprises increasingly adopt generative AI, CDOs must also address talent implications. Some coding tasks can be efficiently handled by generative AI tools, eliminating the need for human programmers. This demands specific training in working with a generative AI "copilot." Senior engineers have demonstrated higher productivity when working alongside generative AI copilots as opposed to junior engineers. Data and AI academies should incorporate generative AI training tailored to various expertise levels. Additionally, the focus should shift towards hiring data engineers, architects, and backend engineers, rather than solely relying on data scientists.

Harnessing generative AI to improve the data function itself presents a significant opportunity for data leaders. Several primary use cases have emerged where generative AI can accelerate existing tasks and enhance performance along the data value chain. While many vendors offer pre-built products, it's crucial for CDOs to identify capabilities that align with their unique business needs. Building proprietary tools for data governance processes ensures greater control and customization. However, it's important to note that many tools and capabilities might work well in experimental environments but may not scale effectively.

Tracking progress and intervening quickly are imperative in an evolving generative AI landscape. Setting up systems to actively monitor and manage generative AI initiatives provides valuable insights into the performance of data in achieving business goals. Effective metrics comprising core KPIs and operational KPIs allow leaders to track progress, identify root causes of issues, and make informed decisions. By understanding which data sources are utilized for high-value models, CDOs can prioritize investments to improve data quality. Developing a comprehensive FinOps-like capability will enable CDOs to manage the growing cost structure surrounding generative AI, optimizing costs and making data-driven decisions.

Data cannot be an afterthought in generative AI but should be seen as the driving force behind a business's ability to capture value. CDOs need to go beyond data management and understand how to leverage data effectively to lead the business forward.
