Tech companies have reached new heights of success, but they now face the challenge of maintaining sustainable growth. Investors are demanding more than just rapid expansion, and organizations are seeking ways to generate steady cash flows, improve productivity, reduce costs, and provide an exceptional customer experience. Effective data management is a crucial element in excelling across all these areas and achieving sustainable growth. Surprisingly, many tech companies struggle with managing their own operational data, despite relying on customer data to power their business models and offerings. Poor-quality data and a lack of governance processes hinder their data management efforts.

To overcome these challenges and drive sustainable growth, tech companies can leverage four data-driven areas. First, transforming business models can help generate steady cash flows by adopting service models that create reliable monthly income streams. This shift requires better data integration capabilities and the aggregation of data typically trapped in spreadsheets to provide customers with on-demand access to usage data and other information.

Second, managing internal costs is crucial for reducing expenses and optimizing resource allocation. Tech companies can identify critical data use cases and calculate the value at stake to build momentum for their data initiatives. Insights from data solutions can help determine efficient configurations for R&D, decrease energy use in data centers, optimize supplier costs, and improve business outcome predictions.

Third, raising productivity through robotic process automation (RPA) can unlock capacity by automating manual tasks. However, incomplete or low-quality data often hampers the effectiveness of automation solutions. With proper data management, companies can automate workflows and redirect employees to higher-value tasks, increasing efficiency and accuracy.

Lastly, improving data security and privacy is essential to protect customer information and prevent data breaches. Tech companies need to prioritize data regulations compliance and invest in robust frameworks that enable faster breach detection and minimize the impact of data leaks. Building trust with customers by ensuring data security can help safeguard the company's reputation and retain customers.

To successfully implement these data-driven levers, tech companies must focus on elevating their data management capabilities. Creating a central repository of internal data and curated data products can increase availability without sacrificing speed. Tech companies can learn from both M&A-driven data ecosystems and centralization approaches to create an ecosystem that combines the best of both. Additionally, establishing a data governance program is crucial for ensuring data security and traceability. Tech companies should prioritize critical data assets, define data domains, roles, and ownership, and consider deploying digital tools to automate data governance processes. Lastly, launching "data quality at scale" programs can help address poor data quality by using AI tech solutions, implementing incentive models to improve data quality, and enforcing quality controls where data is generated.

By embracing these strategies and elevating their data management capabilities, tech companies can unlock their full growth potential, achieve sustainability, and excel in a competitive industry. We have identified an opportunity for tech companies to enhance their growth, cash flow, efficiency, and data security by investing in internal data initiatives. By implementing standardized controls for applications that generate data, we can ensure consistent adherence to industry best practices. This strategic move will not only support our ongoing success but also meet the growing demands of our customers for robust data security measures.
