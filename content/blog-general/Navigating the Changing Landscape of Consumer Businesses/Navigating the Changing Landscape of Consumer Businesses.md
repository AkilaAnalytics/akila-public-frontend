Leaders of consumer It is crucial for accountable executives to have complete
visibility into the inner workings of the business. Moreover, consumer companies
that have undergone a transformation in decision-making speed by "solving a
problem only once" have gained a significant advantage. These companies
establish effective processes and platforms that enable all members of the
organization to learn and reuse solutions to common issues across various
markets, customer segments, or business units. By prioritizing visibility and
transparency, they cultivate a mindset that permeates the entire enterprise.

A multinational food retailer encountered an interesting scenario when one of
its European markets initiated a study on achieving carbon neutrality in its
store locations, just a few months after another European market had already
tackled the same issue. In response, the company has sought to establish a
cultural norm of embracing "shameless stealing." They encourage business leaders
to commit to utilizing and improving existing solutions rather than reinventing
the wheel.

Consumer leaders who strive to rewire their organizations must first conduct a
comprehensive and unbiased assessment of how their companies measure up to each
imperative mentioned above. Based on our experience, most companies excel in
certain areas while lagging behind in others. Rather than tackling all
imperatives simultaneously, consumer leaders should adopt a phased approach that
focuses on the areas where improvement is most needed. The time to take action,
regardless of your starting point, is now.
