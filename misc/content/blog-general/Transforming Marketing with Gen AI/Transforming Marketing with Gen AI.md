Imagine a world where marketers have complete creative freedom and can deliver the perfect offer to the right person, at the right time, in a seamless and cohesive way. This world is now within reach, thanks to the power of Generative AI (gen AI). Gen AI is revolutionizing consumer marketing by enabling hyperpersonalization at scale, driving efficiency gains and unlocking valuable customer insights.

The productivity gains from gen AI are not limited to individual companies. According to a recent report, gen AI has the potential to contribute up to $4.4 trillion in annual global productivity, with marketing and sales being one of the functional groups that can reap the most benefits. Marketers can leverage gen AI to roll out marketing campaigns with speed and precision, personalize customer experiences, and gain deeper understanding of innovation opportunities.

Companies that hesitate to embrace gen AI risk falling behind in this rapidly evolving landscape. In this article, we explore three ways consumer companies can create value with gen AI. First, companies can start by incorporating off-the-shelf gen AI models into their existing workflows to generate immediate value. This includes tasks such as content generation, campaign personalization, and customer feedback analysis. Second, companies can differentiate themselves by developing customized gen AI solutions that are trained on their own data sets. This allows for exponential improvements in customization and innovation. Third, companies can envision a future where gen AI is integrated into every aspect of marketing, creating unique and highly tailored customer experiences.

Getting started with gen AI in marketing is a journey. Companies should ensure that their efforts align with their overall marketing goals and focus on a few high-priority use cases where off-the-shelf gen AI tools can provide immediate impact. Throughout the process, it's important to establish measures to mitigate risks such as hallucinations, biases, data privacy violations, and copyright infringement. Responsible and accountable leadership, as well as a technology oversight board, are crucial for success.

To truly differentiate themselves, companies can go beyond off-the-shelf solutions and develop customized gen AI models that meet their specific needs. By reshaping existing gen AI models with their own data, companies can unlock exponential improvements in customization and innovation. Case studies have shown significant success in areas such as hyperlocal outreach and product development, where gen AI has enabled more targeted messaging
