Technology is evolving at an unprecedented pace, bringing about radical changes
in every industry. One disruptive technology that is gaining momentum is
generative AI (gen AI). This powerful tool has the potential to create
substantial value in various businesses. However, the impact of gen AI will not
be uniform across all industries and countries. It is essential for CFOs to
identify the opportunities that gen AI can offer and allocate resources
accordingly.

Gen AI is a predictive language model that can generate new unstructured
content, such as text, images, and audio. Unlike traditional analytical AI, gen
AI doesn't calculate or do math. Instead, it predicts what a human would enjoy
or find useful. This technology complements traditional AI and can enhance human
lives by enabling new innovations in robotics and automation.

To unlock the potential of gen AI, CFOs must identify the projects that create
the most value for the enterprise. They should prioritize the opportunities that
align with the company's goals, regardless of whether they are driven by gen AI.
The CFO's role is to allocate resources boldly and rapidly, ensuring that the
projects with the highest value receive the necessary funding.

However, implementing gen AI company-wide is not feasible, and CFOs should
instead focus on a small number of use cases that can have a meaningful impact
on the finance function. By prioritizing specific use cases, CFOs can accelerate
their learning curve and effectively leverage gen AI within their organization.

CFOs should not overlook the risks associated with gen AI. The technology can
make errors and produce misleading results. Legal issues, privacy breaches, and
model bias are significant concerns that need to be addressed. It is crucial for
CFOs to play a role in identifying and mitigating these risks, either
independently or in partnership with a separate risk team.

To drive innovation and maximize shareholder value, CFOs need to champion gen AI
initiatives. They should continually seek information about opportunities and
threats, clarify risk appetite, and establish clear risk guardrails for using
gen AI. CFOs can empower their own team members to build relationships across
the organization and better understand the assumptions behind innovation
projects.

In the finance function, gen AI can be a game-changer. It has the potential to
save time and resources, leading to more efficient and effective financial
operations. Finance functions in large enterprises are expected to adopt gen AI
in significant ways within the next three to five years. CFOs should embrace gen
AI as a necessary tool for enhancing the performance of their function.

Getting started with gen AI may seem daunting, but CFOs don't need to be experts
in predictive language models. They can begin
